## Introduction
The Movie Recommendation System is a comprehensive application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to provide personalized movie recommendations based on content similarity. The system processes and analyzes movie data to suggest films that are similar in content to a user-specified movie.

## Features
- Data Integration: Merges detailed movie information from multiple datasets.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handles missing values, extracts features, and performs text cleaning.
- Feature Engineering: Combines textual features into a single tags column and applies stemming.
- Vectorization and Similarity Computation: Transforms text into token counts and computes cosine similarity between movies.
- Recommendation Engine: Provides top five movie recommendations based on content similarity.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- AST
